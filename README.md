This project is a simulation of polymers growth as self-avoiding random walk based on Rosenbluth algorithm and later optimized by Pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method. The two methods will be compared. The polymers are represented as chains of beads with groups of atoms represented as point particles, placed on a square lattice. An ensamble of polymers is 'grown' and physical quantities such as radius of gyration are extracted. 

To run the code please run file main.py which is powered by Polymer.py, Ensamble.py and WorldMap.py
